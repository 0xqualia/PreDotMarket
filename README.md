# Pre.Market

## Abstract

Currently end users wanting to speculate on projects during price discovery period(pre TGE) either don't have access to tools to facilitate the trade of their pre-market allocations / points or in some cases only have access to extremally primitive solutions like telegram OTC channels with trusted third-parties that facilitate the trades and require both parties to trust them with their collateral. 
That isn't good for sellers since they don't know if they will actually get their collateral + buyer collateral after TGE. On the other hand buyers have to worry if they will receive tokens and whether that's gonna happen immediately post-TGE.

## Overview

Platform for OTC trading pre-market tokens that were traditionally illiquid and turning them into completely new asset class, these assets include:

- Airdrop points
- Vested locked tokens
- Significant token allocations held by founders / VCs / KOLs that cannot be sold on open market due to price impact
- Tokenized private equity

## What is your productâ€™s unique value proposition?

- 0% fees(seriously)
- Verfiability of deposits through cross-chain ZK proofs(e.g. proving that seller sent tokens after TGE on chain X so that buyer's collateral can be unlocked on chain Y)
- Direct relationship with every ecosystem if we have pre market for their token
- OTC marketplace accessible from the dapp 24/7 with trades facilitated through smart contracts, not through telegram requiring users to negotiate trade directly with OTC desk owner and wait for his replies

## Who is your target customer?
- Founders
- VCs
- KOLs
- Whales with significant token allocations in specific projects
- Retail users that want early access to token allocations
- Airdrop farmers that want to sell their farmed points pre-TGE
